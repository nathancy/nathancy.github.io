Application architectures serve as tools to enable streamlined, organized, and efficient platforms for developing web applications. One such framework is Meteor which is a modern, internet-based, client-server framework which allows developers to focus more on implementing features and designing user interfaces rather than worrying about the details involving pixel spacing, margins, and database initialization. Through this streamlined platform which allows speedy development through features such as “hot code push”, free server hosting, and organized database management, Meteor is one of the fastest ways to build JavaScript applications. 

Although the benefits that come with Meteor enable smooth integration with many other technologies, there is an unavoidable learning curve. Initially, getting acquainted to the general layout, syntax, dependencies, and interactions between the various files that connect the HTML and JavaScript files can stump first time users. Meteor utilizes a confusing structured file directory where functions and files must be imported into various subdirectories. After understanding this structured system, users then must understand the interaction between templates, helper functions, event handlers, and scripts which power the application. 

For users who have never been exposed to frameworks, concepts such as reactive variables which can modify elements in real-time or conditional logic in HTML files may seem surprising and enlightening. Similarly, the relationship between accessing elements in collections and their connections to helper functions may seem completely unrelated and confusing. Although the learning curve may be steep, the adoption of the platform may be smoother by accepting the jarring syntax and putting side any prior knowledge of a framework structure. Personally, the best method to learning Meteor was to assume the platform would distort any perceived notion of a framework and instead, conform to the syntax with a fresh mind. After passing the initial learning curve, Meteor’s benefits can easily be utilized to rapidly create web applications instead of worrying about wiring disparate components together. 

As a first impression, Meteor seemed intimidating with its complexity. But through time devoted to understanding the framework, syntax, and application structure, Meteor has proved to be an essential tool for creating web applications.
